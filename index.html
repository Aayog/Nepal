                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, 800 kilometres (497 mi) long and 200 kilometres (124 mi)
                        wide, with an area of 147,181 km<sup>2</sup>(56,827 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26&deg;
                        and 31&deg;N, and longitudes 80&deg; and 89&deg;E.</p>
                    <p>Nepal is commonly divided into three physiographic areas: Himal, Pahad and Terai. These
                        ecological belts run east-west and are vertically intersected by Nepal's major, north to south
                        flowing river systems.</p>
                    <h4>Climate</h4>
                    <p>Nepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to the altitudes. The tropical and
                        subtropical zones lie below 1,200 metres (3,937 ft), the temperate zone 1,200 to 2,400 metres
                        (3,937 to 7,874 ft), the cold zone 2,400 to 3,600 metres (7,874 to 11,811 ft), the sub arctic
                        zone 3,600 to 4,400 metres (11,811 to 14,436 ft), and the Arctic zone above 4,400 metres (14,436
                        ft). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal#Climate">See More</a></p>
